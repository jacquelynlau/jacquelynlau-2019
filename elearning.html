        <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> About the Project </h1>
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> Redesigned a Physiotherapy graduate school course to improve design and user engagement. </br> </br></p>
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> <b>My Role:</b> Project Lead, UX/UI Design</p>
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> <b>Tools Used:</b> Articulate Storyline 3, Adobe Illustrator, Jira </br></br></p>
        
            
        <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Project Context </h1>
            
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> 
                    Our client, a professor from the university's Physiotherapy graduate program approached our department to redesign her course on Articulate Storyline 3. 
                    As project lead, I led a team of colleagues and looked through the old modules to research what needed to be improved. From there, we addressed the
                    problems and made a brand guide to keep the design consistent. 
            </br> </br></p>
        
            <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Problem </h1>
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> 
            We identified 3 major user experience and design concerns: <br> <br>
            <ul class = "project-paragraph">
                    <b>Inconsistent Colours and Theme:</b> <br> The colour palette throughout the modules were inconsistent and did 
                    not match the official university's colour branding. The layout of each slide varied from one another, therefore we made 
                    a template that could be applied across all the slides in the modules. <br> <br>

                    <b>Misalignment:</b> <br> Graphics, videos, and text were misaligned throughout the slides and looked inconsistent. Having a visually
                    appealing design in eLearning is extremely important for the student's education and how they perceive the material presented.
                    <br> <br>

                    <b>Disorganization:</b> <br> Slides were poorly organized with no titles or page numbers. When we tested the modules, navigating them was confusing and we were constantly lost. 
                    Unorganization in eLearning can negatively impact a student's progress in learning.  <br> 

                    </ul>
                </p> 

                    <h1 class = "project-caps-heading"> DESIGN PROCESS </h1>
                
        <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Define the Users </h1> 
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> This specific Physiotherapy graduate course is taken by an older student demographic who are not as comfortable with technology. 
            Therefore, we needed to implement simple yet effective solutions. </p>
            </br></p>   

        <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Before and After </h1> 
            <p class = "project-paragraph">
                 <a href="images/storylinefix.png" target="_blank"> <img src="storylinefix.png" class="card-img-top flow"></a>

         <h1 class = "project-caps-heading"> CONCLUSION </h1>       
        <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> What I Learned </h1>
        <p class ="project-paragraph"> This project was the first time where I was the project lead. At first, it was challenging to 
            use Jira to organize the project when we all worked different shifts. However, I quickly learned how useful Jira can be for communication.
            Being a project lead was different from my usual role, I had to learn to delegate tasks and listen to any concerns that my colleagues brought up. 
            I learned that communication with the team was essential in creating a successful product. Overall, being a project lead was scary at first but I quickly learned and felt comfortable in that role.
