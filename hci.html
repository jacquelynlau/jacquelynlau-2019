            <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> About the Project </h1>
                <p class = "project-paragraph"> Collaboratively redesigned the voicemail system into a mobile application with a visual interface. </br> </br></p>
                <p class = "project-paragraph"> <b>My Role:</b> UX/UI Design </p>
                <p class = "project-paragraph"> <b>Tools Used:</b> Adobe Illustrator, Adobe XD </br></br></p>

            <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Project Context </h1>
                <p class = "project-paragraph"> Take an existing application or system, identify user experience flaws, and redesign it to make it better.</br> </br></p>

            <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Problem </h1>
                <p class = "project-paragraph"> The current system in place uses a combination of voice and
                        number pad input, making the experience very complicated, unintuitive, and frustrating for the user. We
                        are attempting to cater to the user in a visual email-like system. We identified 3 major user experience concerns: <br> <br>
                        <ul class = "project-paragraph">
                        <b>Linearity of Interaction:</b> <br>  Users can only navigate their inbox by selecting numbers on
                             a keypad, and are limited to the options available in the current state. Since the feedback they 
                             receive is audio only, the user’s access to the current state of this inbox is limited to the ongoing audio that they are
                             hearing. Audio feedback is not good accessible design for those who are auditory impaired. <br> <br>

                        <b>10-day Lifetime of Messages:</b> <br>Some mobile carriers automatically delete any voicemail messages that are
                            more than 10 days old, including messages that users have not yet listened to. <br> <br>
                        <b>Perpetual Notification:</b> <br>When users receive a voicemail, a
                            notification appears at the top of their phone that can be removed only by listening to the message. The 
                            user is not able to remove this notification by swiping it or by opening their voicemail app;
                            they must listen to the actual message.
                            </ul>
                        </br></p>

            <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Challenges </h1>
                <p class = "project-paragraph"> When creating this application, we couldn't connect with the real mobile carriers.
                                                To work around this challenge, we created fake audio messages and contacts. However in reality, 
                                                this voicemail application would work with mobile carriers to access the user's voicemail system.
                                                </br> </br></p>

            <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Application Summary </h1>
                <p class = "project-paragraph"> In the application, users are able to view “cards” holding information about the voicemail 
                                                such as: sender phone number, contact name, and date. When cards are clicked, they expand 
                                                revealing play, favourite, and delete functions, and can be replayed indefinitely by the user 
                                                until they manually delete it.
                                                 </br></br>
                                                Users will also be able to reveal a menu displaying multiple different types of mail boxes, including:
                                                inbox, favourited, archived, and deleted; these will allow the user to swap which mailbox they are
                                                currently viewing. Users are also able to organize the voicemails by name or date sent.
                                                </p>

            <h1 class = "project-caps-heading"> DESIGN PROCESS </h1>

            <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Define the Users </h1>
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> Voicemail systems are used by people of all ages and is most common with working professionals and older demographics.
                                            However, younger demographics especially millennials tend to avoid using voicemail. We want our application 
                                            to bridge all age groups especially the younger generations. We want our interface to look clean and easy to navigate for all ages.                         
                                            </br></br> </p>

            <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Design Principles </h1>
            <p class = "project-paragraph">  
                
                                            <ul class = "project-paragraph">
                                            <b> Chunking: </b> <br> The input field for the phone number has been automatically chunked for the user. 
                                            This allows for increased readability, and ease of detecting any typos. In addition, the cards contain 
                                            chunked information, that allows the user to quickly scan separate pieces of information.<br> <br>

                                            <b> Constraints:  </b> <br> Users are unable to continue unless a compatible number of digits are inputted. 
                                            Users will not be able to input an invalid phone number, digit-wise, and limits the 
                                            potential error to be the misinput of the user’s phone number string. Users cannot enter more than 
                                            10 digits of a Canadian number.  <br> <br>

                                            <b> Alignment: </b> <br> Card information has been aligned in order of importance, starting from left alignment, 
                                            where the user’s eyes will be naturally drawn to first, then to the call button on the upper right-hand side. <br> <br>

                                            <b> Colour: </b> <br> Bright colors are used to draw attention to important features, such as errors and continue buttons. 
                                            Red shows the user that there has been an error, while blue indicates that a button can be pressed. 
                                            Greyed out buttons indicate the buttons that can’t be interacted with yet.  <br> <br>

        <p class ="project-paragraph"> 
                To improve the design of our system further, we could use fewer borders and used bubble rectangles instead with shading to create separate cards.
                We could also implement more background colours, without adding unneeded noise to the application. To increase the usability of our application, adding a help page
                to describe each screen may help users to understand how to use the application. A further venture that this application can 
                encapsulate is an additional option to transcribe the voicemails in the application making it more user friendly for auditory impaired individuals.
