            I am a UX/UI designer and front-end developer fresh out of the 
            University of Western Ontario with a BSc double degree
            in <span class = "bold">Computer Science</span> and <span class = "bold">Medical Science.</span>

        </br> </br> 
        
        Throughout my childhood, whether it was playing violin from the age of 5 or attending an arts high school, 
        I was constantly surrounded and stimulated by the arts. I didnâ€™t realize how much of a positive impact it had on me
        until I started the Medical Sciences program where I ended up feeling lost and unsatisfied.

        </br> </br> 
        During the end of my 2nd year of university, I picked up a few Computer Science courses 
        and instantly felt stimulated, both mentally and creatively. From there, I decided to bridge 
        these fields together. With my creative and analytical mindset, it enables me to 
        solve complex problems and develop well-crafted, meaningful experiences.
