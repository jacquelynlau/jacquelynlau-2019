            <p class = "project-paragraph"> A desktop, arcade-style game where players must defend the Earth's last pizza from aliens. </br> </br></p>

        <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Project Context </h1>
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> The game "Pizza Guard" came from the unexpected mashup of two seemingly unrelated concepts. 
                                            Our professor provided us with two lists of random words and we had to choose a word from each list. 
                                            From there, the idea of our game evolved from the two words: "Pizza Guard" </br></br> </p>
        
        <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Game Summary </h1>                                   
            <p class = "project-paragraph"> In this game, the players are the pizzeria's workers and they must guard the pizzeria from waves of invading aliens.
                                            Armed with their choice of weapon, the player can shoot and destroy the aliens that are trying to reach one of the four slices of pizza inside. 
                                            This pizza represents how many lives are left for each level. When an alien reaches the pizza, one slice will disappear with them. 
                                            When all four slices have been taken, you lose. </br></br>
                                            
                                            There are three levels that increase in difficulty and a final boss level you must beat to successfully complete the game. 
                                            The final boss level takes place in space where you face off against the aliens' mothership. 
                                            The player has to shoot at the mothership while also navigating their own ship to avoid the bullets from the mothership. </p>

            <p class = "project-paragraph"> As part of our project, each group member did a competitive analysis of a similar game. I did mine on <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ZpbFou2tDtiCyH_2a87KBnL0vkFs4tJ/view?usp=sharing">Angry Birds.</a>
                                            From there, we reviewed and improved the initial idea of our game. </p>     

        <h1 class = "project-sub-heading"> Define the Users </h1> 
            <p class = "project-paragraph">This game is targeted towards people of all ages especially children. Therefore, we decided to keep the animations fun and bright with basic buttons and a game play that was easy to navigate. </p>
