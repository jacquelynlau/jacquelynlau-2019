        <p3>About This Project</br></p3>
        <p2>We were assigned to a team of five students where we had to choose words from a list to as a prompt. Our prompt was "Pizza Guard"
            and that was what we based our game idea around. We collaboratively brainstormed the game idea and developed the game 
            on Game Maker Studio 2. The object of the game is to defend Earth's last pizza from invading aliens. There are 
            3 levels that increase in difficulty and a final boss level that you must beat to completely finish the game. </br> </br></p2> 



        <p3>Work Progress</br></p3>
        <p2>After coming up with the game idea, we worked on how the game would flow.</p2> 
        <p2>Then we designed the different game screens.</p2>
